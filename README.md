# The VBA of Wall Street
## Using VBA scripting in Excel to analyze real stock market data. 

I created a script that will loop through all the stocks on multiple worksheets by running it once and take the following info:
- Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
- The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
- The total Volume of the stock
- Ticker symbol
- "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
